## How to Run the App

Since BigTime is not notarized (I don't have a paid Apple Developer account yet), macOS might block the app at first.
If you encounter issues, follow [this guide on launching non-notarized apps](https://appleinsider.com/inside/macos/tips/how-to-launch-any-macos-app-even-those-not-notarized-by-apple). üçè
